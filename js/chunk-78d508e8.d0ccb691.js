There was not much of an ability to limit this since the content was CMS driven in Wordpress and the nodes are floating around the screen, meaning that any story with X number of videos in it could pop up at any time, on any screen. I ended up using a pool of video players that were built on Cinder-WMFPlayer, which solved most of the problems around UI hitches during video loads.

This caused a nice rolling effect, which really improved the 'underwater' feeling of the scene. If the nodes are really bunched up, I just kill them off by shooting the node backward in the Z direction, causing it to fade out in the fog. Similarly, if there aren't enough nodes of a given type within a region, a suitable node is spawned and faded in from far away along the z-axis, so that it fades in naturally.

Maximum and minimum positions are set that restrict the node to reasonable distortions within the UI, but they are otherwise still updated within the physics loop.
